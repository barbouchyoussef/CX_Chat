Classify each of the following reviews about the brand '{brand_name}'.

The reviews may be in French, Arabic, English or any other language. ALWAYS respond in
ENGLISH: every label you produce is printed in an English-language client report.

For EACH review, determine:
1. Sentiment polarity: "positive", "neutral", or "negative".
2. A confidence score (0.0 to 1.0).
3. The key topics discussed. Maximum 3 topics.
4. If the sentiment is "negative", the matching complaint category. Otherwise null.

No industry is assumed: derive the TOPICS from what the reviews actually say. For a telecom
they will concern network or billing, for a restaurant the food or table service, for a bank
fees or processing times.

RULE for 'themes' — the specific SUBJECT the review is about, in the brand's own domain:
SHORT English labels (1 to 3 words), reused verbatim from one review to the next
(for example "Network", "Fibre", "Food quality", "Delivery", "Bank fees"). These labels are
counted, so two phrasings of one subject would corrupt the statistics.

RULE for 'complaint_category' — the DIMENSION of the problem, which MUST be chosen from the
closed list below and copied exactly. These dimensions are universal and apply to any
industry; the precise detail of the problem belongs in the topic, not here.
Never invent another value: use "Other" if none fits.
{dimensions_block}

You must return EXACTLY one object per review, carrying its original index.
