"""Runs a social scrape as a background job instead of inside the HTTP request.

A full run takes up to 8 minutes: three Apify actors, then classification, then report
generation. Holding the request open for that long fails at any reverse proxy (nginx and
ALB default to 60s, Azure App Service to 230s) and throws away a run the client has already
paid Apify for, because nothing was persisted until the handler returned.

The job row is the unit of durability: `/run` creates it and returns immediately, the task
updates it as work lands, and the browser polls. Closing the tab no longer cancels anything.
