"""Integration guard for the RAG-backed session chatbot.

Verifies chat_with_session takes the shared-engine path when a session_id is present: it builds
the index from the session's documents, retrieves relevant chunks, and answers with citations --
without touching the network (the LLM is faked) or a 470MB embedding model (lexical fallback).
